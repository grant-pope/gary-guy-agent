[00:01] a agents can make videos now you can see
[00:03] this this goes ahead and runs it
[00:05] analyzes these texts and then creates
[00:07] these videos and make random videos here
[00:09] but I actually want to go ahead and
[00:10] update this today so I'm going to do
[00:11] that and I'm going to show you every
[00:12] single step of the way and I'm going to
[00:13] give you all the code so what I want to
[00:15] do here is call this um I'm going call
[00:18] this the video clip agent clipping agent
[00:21] clipping
[00:22] agent um vid Clips vid clip agent this
[00:27] let's change this one to video agent
[00:29] from
[00:31] um short
[00:33] clips short
[00:37] um short vid agent and then I'mma make a
[00:40] new agent here called video agent or
[00:43] clip agent oh [ __ ] video clip agent
[00:50] video clips agent Clips
[00:53] agent py here and this is going to be go
[00:57] ahead and be Eclipse agent here
[01:00] so the whole idea behind this is to be
[01:03] able to take long
[01:04] videos be able to take long videos and
[01:06] make short videos out of it
[01:10] 777 so the idea here is okay I actually
[01:14] have a Clips channel in my Discord here
[01:18] where we I had just have so much fire on
[01:21] this YouTube channel that I don't have
[01:23] time I don't have time to get to so I
[01:25] put this Clips channel here dude and you
[01:27] can see this Clips channel here explains
[01:29] the whole process but essentially you
[01:30] get paid per 10,000 views so right now
[01:33] it's $69 per 10,000 views but it might
[01:36] be more in the future I love you too
[01:38] thank you 777 much love to you dude
[01:40] anyways you can see here that um in the
[01:44] Discord go to mb.com to get the Discord
[01:47] but um you see you can get paid for
[01:50] 10,000 views but the thing is dude is
[01:54] this isn't just me this is all of the
[01:56] streamers every single streamer out
[01:58] there has long videos that need short
[02:02] videos they need shorter videos because
[02:05] there's gold in those long videos now
[02:07] I'm not going to say there's golden
[02:08] entertainment long videos like all the
[02:11] you know the Neons and the Aiden Rosses
[02:14] and the all those streamers dude I don't
[02:16] know maybe there is gold cool but
[02:18] there's literal gold here in my videos
[02:20] so with this video agent essentially
[02:23] what I'm going to show you how to do is
[02:25] how to take these long videos and make
[02:27] short videos and then if you upload them
[02:29] to your channel you get
[02:31] paid okay so super easy to do and I
[02:34] actually have some really good examples
[02:36] here uh of how people have been doing
[02:39] this so let me just go ahead and grab
[02:41] those real
[02:45] quick so there's one here and then
[02:49] here's
[02:50] another
[02:54] um where it go
[03:02] okay so we have two examples two great
[03:04] examples of this so these guys are
[03:06] crushing
[03:08] it examples so you get
[03:14] paid by most
[03:18] streamers to make short videos of their
[03:23] clips of their content make clips of
[03:25] their com content clips of their
[03:28] videos of the
[03:31] streams I have so much gold in my
[03:36] videos and things that can
[03:40] truly help
[03:42] people if you want to learn how to code
[03:48] and get paid while you do it you should
[03:53] just
[03:53] watch my videos and when you
[03:57] see something
[04:00] you think it's gold make a clip out of
[04:02] it and you get paid by me for it you get
[04:05] paid right now check out the clip
[04:08] Channel check out the clips channel in
[04:13] Discord for more info okay let's just
[04:17] put that channel directly in there dude
[04:20] let's go to the clips
[04:22] bro let's go to the clips let's go ahead
[04:24] and say create invite here and edit
[04:28] invite link dude no limit
[04:30] soldiers No Limit soldiers Duke generate
[04:34] New Link
[04:36] okay examples examples of people
[04:40] crushing
[04:42] it with my videos literally with my
[04:47] videos much love to you
[04:49] Stark much love to you Stark much love
[04:52] to you code Freedom dude hope you guys
[04:54] are doing great dude thank you for
[04:56] sending the Good Vibes bro 777 keep them
[04:59] coming through all day please please
[05:02] please okay
[05:05] so they
[05:08] essentially they essentially get paid to
[05:11] watch my coding
[05:14] videos and make clips of the good parts
[05:20] essentially
[05:22] because because I don't have time to
[05:26] make Clips I can only stream
[05:30] as I'm building my
[05:36] alos but you may have time you may you
[05:41] may you you can get off on this dude
[05:43] okay so you know the plan so what I want
[05:45] to do here is I want to first off take
[05:48] one of these long video okay let's go
[05:50] ahead and show these examples here first
[05:52] off okay so this is the clips agent here
[05:55] and let's go to
[05:57] the my
[06:01] let's go look at these videos dude
[06:03] because these guys are absolutely
[06:04] crushing this video thing dude they're
[06:07] clipping these videos up amazingly I
[06:10] watch these videos now I'm going
[06:12] subscribe you should subscribe as
[06:15] well so you can see they're essentially
[06:17] taking my longer videos and making
[06:19] shorter videos of them putting a nice
[06:21] thumbnail on them putting a good title
[06:23] on them and you can see here they're
[06:25] just shorter versions of my videos the
[06:28] one thing I would say that would do
[06:29] better for them is if they were a little
[06:31] bit longer videos but I'll show you how
[06:33] to do all of that here today so not only
[06:36] are you going to be learning every
[06:37] single thing because you're going to be
[06:38] literally watching the videos and then
[06:40] you know cutting them up in order to
[06:42] make the good segments so you in
[06:45] inherently learn how to code you
[06:48] inherently learn how to outgo trade cuz
[06:50] you're stepping on the gas every single
[06:52] day it's beautiful beautiful stuff dude
[06:54] beautiful stuff so you can see here my
[06:58] focus agent about to yell at me 7.10
[07:01] stay focused on the coding process each
[07:03] line of code brings you closer to
[07:05] mastering your craft thank you
[07:07] bro thank you bro thank you bro anyways
[07:10] you can see how they're doing it um I
[07:13] would say the one difference I would do
[07:14] if I were you is I would make these
[07:17] longer videos you know my videos are 4
[07:19] hours so take out like the 15 minute the
[07:21] 20 part minute parts and I'll show you
[07:23] how to build this agent out here today
[07:25] so you can have this all pretty much
[07:26] automated for you so you can see all you
[07:29] you got to do is start a YouTube channel
[07:31] it's all on YouTube it's YouTube only um
[07:35] but it's pretty chill dude because all
[07:37] you're doing is learning and then
[07:38] uploading the good parts maybe put a
[07:40] little thumbnail on it you can even use
[07:41] my thumbnails take my thumbnails I don't
[07:43] care take my videos take my thumbnails
[07:45] take everything dude I believe code is a
[07:47] great equalizer I believe if you learn
[07:48] how to code you'll change your life
[07:52] dude so these guys are crushing it and
[07:54] you can see just randomly 2.3 th000
[07:56] views on a video 900 views ,000 views
[08:00] and you get paid every 10,000 views so
[08:02] you can see it's just like might as well
[08:04] if you are actually learning this
[08:06] process you might as well get paid for
[08:08] it okay so let's go ahead and build the
[08:10] agent out now first things first this is
[08:13] what you would do as well you would go
[08:15] over to my YouTube or somebody else's
[08:17] YouTube maybe another streamer's YouTube
[08:19] anywhere that has long videos because
[08:21] the whole goal here is to you know I put
[08:24] my all into these videos dude I I
[08:26] literally show you everything but within
[08:29] those in the long videos there's great
[08:31] parts so essentially your play would be
[08:34] go to my YouTube open some videos that
[08:36] you literally want to watch and learn if
[08:39] you literally care how good you are
[08:41] anything discipline you nobody you
[08:44] nothing have discipline cuz you give up
[08:46] under the slightest struggle without
[08:48] discipline 100% me discipline is doing
[08:50] what you hate to do but do it like you
[08:52] love it doing what you hate to do but do
[08:54] it like you love it that's that is a
[08:57] great quote mhm and if you can do that
[09:00] you could be successful in anything no
[09:01] you normally are so what I would do dude
[09:04] is I would look at the recent videos and
[09:06] I would say which ones have the most
[09:08] views on them and this is my YouTube
[09:10] channel okay which one has the most
[09:12] views on them that tells you where
[09:13] people actually are watching people are
[09:15] interested in okay so the Deep seek AI
[09:17] agents okay uh the Jack dorsy the how to
[09:21] actually use AI agents open the ones
[09:23] that have a lot of views in them 25,000
[09:25] views on this one deep seek AI
[09:30] so look at the ones that have a lot of
[09:31] views and then you could also look at
[09:33] the most popular ones now the tricky
[09:35] thing here is some of these are older so
[09:37] are they going to still be popular I
[09:39] don't know I don't know dude I don't
[09:40] have the time for for doing these
[09:42] clipping things but I I know that some
[09:45] of you do because some of you come to me
[09:47] and be like yo can I make a million
[09:48] dollars overnight with algo trading and
[09:51] algo trading is not how you make money
[09:53] dude it's not how you make money if you
[09:55] have cash that you're trading you can
[09:57] earn a yield on your cash you can you
[10:00] can earn a percentage of your cash yes
[10:02] but it's not like how you're going to
[10:03] make it out of the trenches bro I'm
[10:06] sorry so I I got to do this at least
[10:08] once a week I got to show you guys this
[10:10] because I get so much pressure on me
[10:12] from people saying like I just need to
[10:14] make a hundred bucks I just need to make
[10:15] 200 bucks okay well here dude I'm going
[10:18] to give you my money because I believe
[10:20] code is a great equalizer and I believe
[10:22] if I get this knowledge out to people
[10:24] it's going to change their
[10:26] life it's going to change their life so
[10:29] so if you want to help me with that you
[10:31] can and you get paid for and you learn
[10:33] at the same time so go through my videos
[10:35] find the ones that are good if you need
[10:37] screenshots for the videos you can use
[10:40] mine as well dude watch this I'll just
[10:42] type
[10:43] in download
[10:46] screenshots uh not screenshot thumbnails
[10:49] thumbnails download
[10:52] thumbnails from YouTube now you can also
[10:55] make your own so you can just go here
[10:57] and just grab any any one that I
[11:00] have if you want to use those thumbnails
[11:03] you know make your new titles whatever
[11:06] um you can see that's an easy way to get
[11:07] the thumbnails how do you get the vid
[11:09] well I can't say this out loud but it's
[11:11] the same way it's the same way just type
[11:14] in
[11:18] download video so I can't say that out
[11:21] loud but you know that's how you do it
[11:24] just
[11:26] download the video so you have all of my
[11:29] videos you literally have unlimited
[11:31] access to all of my videos and you can
[11:34] down you can get them you can get them
[11:37] dude just click just Google bro just
[11:40] Google and just get the highest version
[11:42] quality dude click click it um some of
[11:46] these are going to try to scam you in
[11:48] the paint not scam you but uh you know
[11:51] whatever get you to pay um I would look
[11:53] for the ones with the highest resolution
[11:56] here if you can get them uh so I would
[11:58] go to a different website honestly cuz
[12:00] that one's
[12:02] 360p uh let's go ahead and look at 1080p
[12:05] here all of these are you know they all
[12:08] do the same thing I can't talk about
[12:11] this on the stream because they listen
[12:14] to every single
[12:18] word here you go download the 1080p dude
[12:22] if you
[12:23] can it's a little tricky sometimes n it
[12:27] won't let me take take that one seek AI
[12:29] I used to be able to do this uh just put
[12:32] SS in front of
[12:40] it dude they're tightening up
[12:44] bro they're tightening
[12:49] up how do you even get these
[12:52] anymore there's got to be a better way
[12:56] you can use the 360s if you'd like
[13:01] oh HD right here no I ain't
[13:07] it I don't even know how to get them
[13:09] anymore jez
[13:13] bro it's paid where do you get that
[13:20] at all right so step one is getting the
[13:23] video so we got to figure that out
[13:25] first there's usually free ones it's
[13:29] just that I
[13:30] think they try to take them down so you
[13:34] have to play around with this a
[13:36] bit and maybe I can put like a Dropbox
[13:38] link or something with all my video
[13:43] content so maybe I'll do that CU I have
[13:45] all my videos you know they're all in my
[13:48] folder so if I don't figure something
[13:50] out in the next few minutes here I'm
[13:52] just going to go ahead and put them in a
[13:54] folder for you
[14:01] Google
[14:02] 4K I don't want to pay for it though
[14:05] because then it defeats the pro purpose
[14:07] you
[14:07] know because I could pay for it sure but
[14:11] um I want this to be free for you
[14:18] guys all right dude well I've got all
[14:20] the videos so I'm just going to upload
[14:22] them to uh
[14:29] to
[14:31] Dropbox because I got all my videos
[14:34] right here
[14:35] dude they're all right here in this
[14:38] folder
[14:40] so
[14:42] um what I'll do is in this in this
[14:46] here in this uh Discord
[14:50] here I'll go ahead and put a bunch of
[14:53] videos I'll just start putting all my
[14:55] videos here because then it'll be super
[14:57] easy for you to get so now you know you
[15:01] can do this with anybody any streamer or
[15:03] anything it doesn't matter you just have
[15:04] to make sure that they have some sort of
[15:06] program in place I have this program in
[15:07] place because I truly believe if you
[15:09] post these vids dude I will personally
[15:12] watch them and I know that there's so
[15:14] much gold inside of these that if you're
[15:17] able to learn while you post vids dude
[15:21] you get you get paid you get paid to
[15:23] learn dude that's fire somebody hit me
[15:25] in the chat I'm also new to coding I
[15:28] wrote you on I got a project idea for
[15:31] our live stream nice
[15:33] dude fire
[15:36] um so what I'm going to start doing is
[15:38] I'm just going to start doing that right
[15:40] now let's go ahead and get to Dropbox
[15:42] here
[15:45] and how much do I have here in this
[15:48] Dropbox I got
[15:50] 02 I'm going to go ahead and oh I'm in
[15:53] the right Dropbox actually so let's go
[15:56] ahead and say
[16:08] vids
[16:14] unedited I got a bunch of videos dude I
[16:16] got
[16:18] unlimited try to code crypto triangular
[16:21] Arbitrage I built that I buil It B I
[16:24] built it good good idea though dude good
[16:27] idea what love to you thanks
[16:29] appreciate your
[16:36] idea I got my Dropbox open over
[16:45] here OG videos
[16:51] maybe okay I got this dude I'm just
[16:54] going to make some video I'm going to
[16:55] call it uh videos let's say new folder
[16:59] here create folder
[17:04] here all
[17:10] files and let's say create folder here
[17:13] and this will be
[17:15] videos for
[17:22] Clippers okay seeck now I'm going to go
[17:24] upload of videos there stay focused on
[17:27] the task at hand every minute spent on
[17:29] organizing is a minute closer to your
[17:31] goal thank you
[17:35] bro how to actually use AI for
[17:39] trading deep seek so I got all my videos
[17:42] here dude this is far bro I'm about to
[17:45] give you guys so much heat that you can
[17:47] just run with dude you can run with this
[18:12] so this is going to be a way better way
[18:13] anyways because you're going to have
[18:19] um essentially the
[18:23] 1080p you have the 1080p Y 2 mate okay
[18:28] it might have something to do with where
[18:30] I'm located as well
[18:59] I'm uploading a ton of videos right now
[19:02] so damn it might so don't waste it
[19:05] living someone else's life let's see
[19:07] don't be trapped by Dogma which is
[19:09] living with the results of other
[19:11] people's thinking don't let the noise of
[19:14] others opinions drowned out your own
[19:15] inner voice and most important have the
[19:18] courage to follow your heart and
[19:20] intuition they somehow already know what
[19:23] you truly want to become
[19:26] everything secondary
[19:29] so I don't I don't want to I don't want
[19:31] to um send you guys a bad vid vid
[19:34] quality here so let's say
[19:42] 1080p 1080p maybe go try that
[19:47] one 740 is
[19:51] fine P4 here okay
[19:56] look this one works
[20:00] maybe not
[20:02] though mp4
[20:06] download Yo thank you Kyler appreciate
[20:09] you bro much
[20:12] love so yeah the s's constantly Chang
[20:15] okay well I'm going to have uh I'm
[20:18] uploading 30 30 vids so you'll have
[20:21] access to all my new vids um anyways
[20:25] let's go ahead and make sure now that
[20:27] you know
[20:29] the process of I think the key process
[20:32] to this is looking at which ones do well
[20:35] like so there's two ways look at ones
[20:37] that do well number one popular of
[20:39] course but you can see a couple of these
[20:41] are old like five months ago that's not
[20:43] that old that that's not that old these
[20:45] are obviously two hitters
[20:47] here but some of them are like two years
[20:50] old so you know you'll have to do your
[20:51] judgment there and you know just because
[20:54] it has a lot of views or whatever it
[20:56] could be too old but it could also be
[20:57] good so I don't want to like change your
[20:59] mind on anything you know how you can
[21:01] get the thumbnails if you need them you
[21:03] can also use canva canva makes really
[21:06] good thumbnails canva is a visual like a
[21:10] Photoshop a easy Photoshop so you can
[21:12] always make thumbnails there uh the key
[21:15] is to make good titles and stuff and
[21:17] essentially you can go through and just
[21:19] get any of these any of these vids that
[21:21] you feel like you want to watch and
[21:23] learn from because if you are actually
[21:25] learning during it then it's no cost to
[21:28] you you know know what I'm saying
[21:29] because when you have to clip it up well
[21:31] you get to see it again okay so that's
[21:34] fire bro 777 to you dude Kyler you are a
[21:38] gem thank you bro Let the Peace of
[21:40] Christ rule in your hearts dude let's
[21:44] get it okay so let's go ahead and build
[21:46] out this uh full this full um thing
[21:54] here steps to success steps to your
[21:58] success
[22:00] as a
[22:01] Clipper one find good long
[22:06] videos on my
[22:10] channel and then let's go here or
[22:12] someone else's channel that pays
[22:19] you or someone
[22:23] else's that pays
[22:26] you okay and then two
[22:30] watch the video and find the parts that
[22:31] are gold make a uh clip out of
[22:36] it 2 minutes to you know two
[22:45] hours I would honestly say five
[22:48] minutes to two
[22:52] hours
[22:54] upload in
[22:56] length upload the
[22:59] clip
[23:00] to your YouTube
[23:05] channel when you
[23:08] hit 10,000
[23:11] views get
[23:15] paid 69 for now but that may change keep
[23:21] an eye on that may increase
[23:30] honestly let's do it let I'm going to
[23:31] build this to be cooler
[23:34] actually may increase over
[23:38] time let's say
[23:40] uh payout
[23:44] schedule payouts um
[23:50] thresholds uh
[23:52] 10,000
[23:55] views views per month
[23:59] equals
[24:01] 69 per
[24:07] 10K let's say uh 50,000 views per
[24:16] month
[24:19] equals
[24:22] 89 per
[24:25] 10,000 views
[24:29] 100,000 views per
[24:32] month equals 129 per 10,000
[24:37] views no 100
[24:41] per 10,000 views and if you get
[24:47] um let's make this a little easier
[24:51] actually
[24:53] 30,000 and then
[25:06] 50,000 all right payout
[25:09] thresholds
[25:11] so
[25:17] standard but after you get to up to okay
[25:20] 10,000 50,000 per month okay perfect
[25:24] dude so that's
[25:26] awesome um
[25:30] if in the
[25:32] USA you can only earn up
[25:38] to
[25:40] 500 per year but in the rest of the
[25:47] world you can
[25:50] earn
[25:54] unlimited okay
[25:57] so and and then if you get more
[26:00] than let's say
[26:03] 100,000
[26:07] views per month then it's going to be
[26:10] it's going to
[26:12] be 149 per 10,000
[26:19] views okay
[26:22] so at 10,000
[26:25] bonus bonus group here
[26:30] once you hit 10,000
[26:34] views per month you get access to a
[26:40] private channel in
[26:44] Discord with training on how to get more
[26:50] views okay dude so that's how that's the
[26:53] play right now so this is literally the
[26:57] whole this is kind of I've kind of
[26:58] updated this essentially as we go but
[27:06] essentially this AI agent this AI agent
[27:10] will be able to take long videos and
[27:14] make them short
[27:18] videos
[27:20] enabling this AI agent to make money
[27:25] while you sleep not really but you know
[27:29] AI
[27:30] enabling this AI agent to help you earn
[27:36] money while you learn to code you get
[27:41] paid by most streamers to make clips of
[27:43] their
[27:44] streams I have so much gold in my videos
[27:47] and things that can truly help people if
[27:50] you want to learn how to code and get
[27:52] paid while you do it you should just
[27:54] watch my videos and when you see
[27:56] something that is gold you can make make
[27:58] a clip out of it and you can get paid by
[28:02] me for that check out the clips Channel
[28:04] and Discord for more info examples of
[28:07] people crushing it with my
[28:09] videos here's a couple examples they
[28:12] essentially get paid to watch my coding
[28:13] videos and make clips of the good parts
[28:17] because I don't have the time to make
[28:19] Clips I only stream as I'm building my
[28:22] alos steps to your success as a mondev
[28:26] Clipper actually it's a Clipper anywhere
[28:29] let's just say mondav Clipper
[28:31] though a
[28:33] moav
[28:37] Clipper find good long videos on YouTube
[28:40] here we go watch the video and find the
[28:42] parts that are
[28:45] good make a clip out of that video five
[28:48] hours in
[28:51] length sorry 5 minutes to 2 hours in
[28:54] length upload the the clip to your
[28:57] YouTube channel
[28:59] YouTube
[29:01] only no shorts no YouTube
[29:08] shorts when you hit 10,000 views you get
[29:11] paid
[29:15] $69 get
[29:18] paid 69 pay out pay out
[29:25] um standard payment let's say
[29:32] standard it's get involved if you Ain
[29:34] gon for take this I bought some Hol tips
[29:37] for your homeboy 10,000 views per month
[29:39] you get 69 per 10,000 views 30,000 views
[29:42] per month you get 89 per 10,000
[29:46] views 50,000 you get 100 per 10,000
[29:51] views 100,000 you get 149 that's
[29:54] aggressive dude that's aggressive and I
[29:57] don't know if that one will last that
[29:59] one's aggressive bro let's pull that one
[30:02] no let's keep it let's keep it let's see
[30:03] let's see dude uh bonus group once you
[30:06] hit 10,000 views per month you get
[30:09] access to our private Channel and
[30:15] Discord simply uh
[30:19] submit your YouTube uh when you hit
[30:26] 10,000 on the 1st and the 15th payments
[30:29] are
[30:31] payments are via crypto on the 1st and
[30:38] 15th of every month when you hit 10,000
[30:44] views per month

[31:23] for clipping my videos yes now I have
[31:28] this
[31:31] um Dropbox here here's a bunch of raw
[31:35] footage where do I get the videos
[31:38] where do you get the videos
[31:43] from uh my
[31:47] channel uh I will upload let's say one
[31:50] this
[31:52] Dropbox has a
[31:54] bunch of my videos that I will upload to
[32:01] daily so let's go ahead and get that
[32:03] Dropbox share folder here copy link
[32:09] okay copy link
[32:15] here all right so that's that's step one
[32:19] here and then here's the other two you
[32:24] can you have permission have permission
[32:35] to and then
[32:40] um yeah dude what framework is this this
[32:43] is a moev agents framework dude Mev AI
[32:48] agents framework it's right here go to
[32:50] mv.com click road map Discord GitHub you
[32:53] get everything in the road map shows you
[32:54] exactly how to automate your trading and
[32:56] then you go down here do to the
[33:00] uh moev AI agents here and we're
[33:03] building out a a video agent today you
[33:05] come here and you get the GitHub click
[33:06] star in order to save it and fork in
[33:08] order to copy the code it's all you got
[33:10] to do dude and you're good so you got
[33:13] everything I got so I'm going to go
[33:15] ahead and keep updating this here and
[33:18] I'm going to keep writing this out let's
[33:20] go ahead and make sure this is up there
[33:22] where do I get the videos from um are
[33:24] there any questions you guys have any
[33:25] questions based off of this based what I
[33:28] just showed you are there any questions
[33:29] that I could get ahead
[33:31] of
[33:33] um let's see if there's anything I
[33:35] missed in this Clips channel here
[33:37] updated August 14th I believe code is a
[33:40] great equal equalizer that's why I share
[33:42] every single line of code I create every
[33:44] day I do this through streaming my code
[33:46] of trading alos every single day now I
[33:49] understand that it's hard to watch all
[33:50] the streams and I get people asking me
[33:53] for shorter videos I truly believe CA is
[33:55] a greater so it cost 69 per month but
[33:58] you can get it free because I give you
[34:00] 10,000 if you do th 10,000 videos you
[34:03] can or 10,000 views you can get $69 but
[34:06] that could also be free tldr clip my
[34:09] vids post them on your YouTube and when
[34:10] you get 10,000 views okay perfect if you
[34:13] want to get started watch this video
[34:15] once you hit 10,000 views email
[34:17] screenshots of videos stats and links
[34:20] for here paid on the first and the
[34:22] 15th I should make that consistent
[34:25] huh I should make that consistent dude I
[34:28] should make that consistent let's put it

[34:58] this here to the GitHub right now new
[35:01] terminal
[35:04] G.G commit slm
[35:09] um Clips
[35:11] agent that can make
[35:15] money get push here so let's see make
[35:18] sure everything's good okay perfect
[35:22] dude um can you drop the Dropbox link
[35:27] yo so I'll drop the GitHub link right

[35:33] so let's go to the source here clips
[35:36] that can make money here let's go ahead
[35:41] to the clips here Clips agent here and

[35:46] much more many more videos being
[35:48] uploaded to the Dropbox right now so
[35:50] you'll have access to all of my or a lot
[35:53] of my videos a lot of my videos and I'll

[36:11] from because then it's free you know
[36:14] because then you're not you know it's
[36:16] not like you're just over here making
[36:17] videos dude you're literally learning
[36:20] you're learning while you do this so
[36:22] yeah so it's right here this Dropbox has
[36:24] a bunch of videos okay so this is the
[36:26] standard payout 9,000 per 10,000 views
[36:29] but it increases based on your views per
[36:31] month let me know if you have any
[36:33] questions based off of what you've heard
[36:35] so far otherwise I'm going to start
[36:37] building out the clips
[36:38] agent so if you want to read through
[36:40] this real quick and if you got any other
[36:43] questions let me know and then if
[36:44] there's no other questions on how this
[36:46] is set up and how the payments are made
[36:49] all that good stuff then I will just
[36:51] keep moving on to build a Clips agent
[36:53] that will help you with this process and
[36:55] help you clip the videos dude so let me
[36:57] go ahead here and um let's do that dude
[37:01] let's do that let's go ahead and do that
[37:03] I want to go ahead and first um bring
[37:06] one of these long videos one of the Raw
[37:08] videos up in here so let's go put it in
[37:10] the Raw let's go to data I think it
[37:14] would be in the data here and this will
[37:16] be under private data
[37:18] maybe
[37:20] no videos here Raw
[37:26] videos order flow
[37:30] okay I'm going to put one of these in
[37:38] there
[37:46] um let's just put this one in there for
[37:49] now how to
[37:51] use this here and this really big
[37:54] actually
[38:02] so maybe I should copy relative path
[38:05] here I don't need to be uploading that
[38:06] to GitHub dude it's too big get ignore
[38:20] her I need to change that name too I do
[38:24] I do I do I have to use
[38:35] copy path
[38:48] here honestly I could just probably get
[38:50] rid of Raw videos in general okay got
[38:53] that out of there so let me read through
[38:54] this let me know if you have any
[38:55] questions and then let's go ahead and
[38:58] build this agent out to help you out
[39:36] erir okay if you want a pair of shoes
[39:39] and they at the store they're really at
[39:41] the store you just don't have it yet it
[39:43] ain't like that [ __ ] don't exist it's
[39:45] just really at the store that's how I
[39:46] looked at my whole life if I want it if
[39:49] I believe I can have it then that's then
[39:52] that's my reality all right dude so you
[39:54] literally have the whole game plan in
[39:57] here for the clips agent so [ __ ] dude
[40:02] this is fire this is fire okay so since
[40:05] you have access to
[40:08] everything you should be able to step on
[40:10] the gas now not yet well you could
[40:19] actually so let me show you the first
[40:21] way to do this before we do it how to do
[40:25] this uh how do I clip the videos how do
[40:27] I clip the
[40:29] videos uh one download cap
[40:49] cut to find the
[40:53] interesting parts of the video
[40:58] and make a 5 minute
[41:02] to 2our clip of it three make an
[41:10] interesting
[41:18] thumbnail and
[41:20] title for the
[41:24] clip for post on
[41:32] YouTube
[41:34] um you can use
[41:38] my
[41:41] thumbnails if
[41:43] needed just
[41:45] Google how to
[41:48] download post on
[41:50] YouTube when you hit you hit
[41:54] 10,000 views
[41:57] email your link and
[42:03] stats to get
[42:05] paid here's a more here here is another
[42:10] training
[42:12] video it mentions uh the only difference
[42:16] the only
[42:18] difference is
[42:21] that we only accept YouTube videos now
[42:28] the below training is
[42:32] helpful
[42:34] though we only accept Long YouTube
[42:37] videos
[42:40] now okay so let's go ahead and put that
[42:46] there where's that video at dude it's
[42:49] right
[42:51] here copy
[42:58] visit here this is the video all right
[43:00] as you
[43:01] know so there you go now you have you
[43:04] can do it you can start now honestly you
[43:06] can start now you don't even need the AI
[43:07] agent code but I'm going to investigate
[43:09] how to make this easier with AI agents
[43:12] training video
[43:14] here I'm going to make it easier with AI
[43:17] agents dude so let's go ahead and update
[43:21] the REM me real quick n let's do that
[43:23] later okay so now we have this copy path
[43:26] okay
[43:28] so let's go ahead and say I here um let
[43:33] me go ahead first and update this so you
[43:35] have all the instructions on how you can
[43:38] start getting off get commit
[43:42] M uh agent clip agent clip agent to make
[43:47] money while
[43:51] learning clip agent to make money get
[43:55] push okay okay so you got all the code
[43:57] there it's up on github.com and you can
[44:00] get that from mb.com road map Discord
[44:02] GitHub all that good stuff here we go
[44:03] this is the road map and then then the
[44:05] GitHub is here in the moon AI agents
[44:07] when you get there you just go ahead and
[44:09] hit here you go here and it's all right
[44:10] here dud it's all right here dude let's
[44:12] get it all day every day okay here's
[44:15] some good examples of people crushing it
[44:16] 777 like a boss T Ross is up in here
[44:25] yes where do I get the videos from dude
[44:27] I thought I just updated this didn't
[44:30] I what the heck cursor training video I
[44:35] didn't save it that's why okay so let's
[44:38] update it
[44:39] again uh get add. get commit
[44:44] slm and
[44:47] um clip agent to make
[44:51] money get push okay so now we have all
[44:55] this now we can start building to make
[44:57] make this even easier if you are a coder
[45:01] so let's go here and
[45:05] say please look at my focus agent to see
[45:08] how we set up the AI of all of this and
[45:11] bring that
[45:15] in but then I want you to build the
[45:17] below essentially I have a file path
[45:18] that I'll post here and this file path
[45:21] will have
[45:27] [Music]
[45:29] a bunch of different
[45:31] videos it's like going to be a folder of
[45:33] videos and what I want you to do is put
[45:36] me put some constants up top saying how
[45:38] long I want the videos to
[45:39] be so X
[45:43] seconds and then essentially what this
[45:46] will do
[45:48] is split up the videos based on that
[45:51] many
[45:53] seconds and then output them into a new
[45:55] folder called finish
[46:00] Clips so I have a folder I'll be
[46:03] connecting you to called raw click
[46:05] clips and you output the clipped ones
[46:09] into finished
[46:11] Clips I don't know dude I'm not there
[46:13] yet I haven't figured it out yet bro I
[46:16] don't know yet I don't know I don't know
[46:17] anything dude I just go I just build
[46:19] clip raw
[46:25] Clips finish clips let's go say finish
[46:34] Clips finish Clips raw clips and finish
[46:36] Clips let's put this in the Raw Clips
[46:38] here let's get another one up in
[46:40] [Music]
[46:46] there
[46:47] [Music]
[46:50] um deep seek here let's go ahead and put
[46:53] that in
[46:55] there let's go ahead and rename it so
[46:57] it's
[47:07] Kinder okay let's go put raw Clips up in
[47:10] the the
[47:13] GitHub don't share or whatever get
[47:15] [Music]
[47:20] ignore okay so let's go ahead and put
[47:24] raw Clips here
[47:27] and then I have finish Clips here so
[47:29] let's go to agents here data videos
[47:34] finish Clips copy
[47:36] P okay dude so that's that's what the
[47:39] that's what it's going to do I don't see
[47:40] the AI yet but we'll see how I can
[47:43] implement it
[47:58] uh will there be any new lessons based
[48:00] on Moon's latest YouTube videos so much
[48:02] insane content that's distracting but
[48:04] only bits and pieces would be great to
[48:05] have some integrated 15 days special llm
[48:10] code to be honest Moon build a whole
[48:13] different course for AI
[48:16] agents
[48:18] moon to be honest Moon can build a whole
[48:20] different
[48:21] course that's what I thought this course
[48:24] would be I followed him on YouTube how
[48:25] did you think that dude
[48:32] this be crypto AI trading bot um course
[48:34] the very least using GitHub code back
[48:37] test um
[48:41] whereas okay
[48:44] well it's
[48:48] interesting did you read the website
[49:00] oh my
[49:07] god there are some extra days after day
[49:14] 30 though and I will be adding more of
[49:19] this
[49:20] agent stuff that said this the the boot
[49:26] camp the boot camp is all about Alo
[49:33] trading
[49:36] and you get
[49:39] everything on the
[49:46] website plus more really okay
[49:52] um let's go ahead imagine you had
[49:55] everything you wanted
[49:57] everything I love when people imagine
[49:59] you were everything you ever wanted to
[50:01] be and capture that
[50:04] feeling that's the easiest way to
[50:06] manifest what you want so you only get
[50:09] what's on the website so I love when
[50:11] people come up in here and be like yo I
[50:13] thought we were going to get this or
[50:14] that it's like
[50:17] bro bro I literally explained it step by
[50:20] step exactly what you get in the boot
[50:22] camp and people were like I want more
[50:26] I want more dude and I actually give
[50:29] more I give more so much love to them um
[50:33] but yeah if you join the boot camp you
[50:34] get everything on this page it's 15 days
[50:38] here but I'm I'm a I'm a thug so I go
[50:41] ahead and actually give you more days
[50:43] all the way up to 38 days that's crazy
[50:45] dude 69 bucks that's insane that's why I
[50:49] want you if you're if you can't afford
[50:52] it bro then just clip some stuff dude
[50:56] just clip some stuff
[50:59] bro just clip some stuff and you can
[51:01] have you can have it all dude you can
[51:03] have it all okay let's go ahead and see
[51:05] this sir is the boot camp easy to follow
[51:08] I watch your YouTube videos but yes it's
[51:10] easy much easier my friend much
[51:15] easier much much easier to
[51:24] follow much easier to follow this is
[51:27] what the boot camp is for is be short
[51:28] and concise videos obviously I can't
[51:30] start from scratch every single day or
[51:31] else I would get nowhere so that's why I
[51:33] put the boot camp together okay no such
[51:36] file called this Moon dve clipse deep SE
[51:39] okay let's go ahead and say accept
[51:51] here not quite
[51:55] though I'm reject it for
[51:57] [Music]
[52:00] now this is going to be the RBI read
[52:06] me great job but don't change the notes
[52:09] at the top ever I have notes up there on
[52:12] purpose don't change those go ahead and
[52:15] Implement what you had to do though
[52:29] I apologize it's okay don't worry about
[52:32] it big dog I got you you locked I'm
[52:35] locked
[53:06] stay focused on your goals let DET guide
[53:09] back
[53:52] okay dude so we'll keep all those
[53:54] perfect now let's say accept here
[53:58] Movie pie. Editor import Movie pie.
[54:00] Editor
[54:02] okay I need
[54:04] a go ahead and check out movie pie what
[54:07] is PIP install movie pie pip
[54:10] install movie
[54:15] pie python library for editing sounds
[54:18] good to me
[54:19] dude wait wait
[54:24] wait okay okay
[54:31] okay so let's say pip install movie pie
[54:33] now first off look at this video dude
[54:36] this video right here is 10 gigabytes
[54:39] big so it's like 4 hours or something
[54:42] okay so you know it's 4
[54:44] hours so if we build an AI agent to clip
[54:47] it for us that's fire dude and then you
[54:50] just have to figure out a title on the
[54:53] thumbnail okay so and then you just
[54:55] upload it to your YouTube super fire bro
[54:58] Clips agent okay p and star movie pie
[55:06] okay is it done no no module named this
[55:10] okay but I just pip installed it I
[55:13] thought I just pip installed it maybe
[55:14] you can try it and see the
[55:25] air oh looks like we're Gucci
[56:11] great now that we've install it let's
[56:13] run it no movie pie dude seems
[56:17] something unall movie pie thank you
[56:45] let's use a different Library
[57:07] okay import movie pie that
[57:11] way there we go
[57:27] all right let's go ahead and run this
[57:29] because it looks like it's kind of
[57:32] working so input path is raw Clips
[57:36] here and it's actually supposed to
[57:40] be raw Clips finish videos okay looks
[57:44] good to
[57:49] me so let's see finish Clips here it's
[57:52] not working oh snap I see the issue now
[57:56] we need to use Movie pie. Editor no dude
[57:59] stop it
[58:07] reject I'm getting the above air when I
[58:09] try to run
[58:11] it I'm getting the above
[58:25] Arrow e
[59:04] movie pie okay maybe we could use a
[59:06] different way of doing this because
[59:40] saving
[59:44] to so clip duration is 5 minutes and
[59:47] seconds
[60:05] so I think it's clipping
[60:13] now put the
[60:16] work I think it's working
[60:19] dude so it says extracting extracting
[60:22] clip one is creating 74 clips
[60:26] yeah dude yeah
[60:37] yeah let's see if it gets one of them
[60:40] done if it gets one of them done I got a
[60:41] good idea dude
[61:03] so this clip as it's going to be sick
[61:12] dude it's going to be sick B
[61:48] so splitting z%
[61:52] though maybe because it's so big
[62:07] I think it's because it's big but we'll
[62:12] see there it
[62:15] goes splitting clip one it looks like it
[62:18] had a air 1% splitting
[62:21] video spling the let's say cancel and
[62:24] resume dude
[62:28] I see the issue we have a numpy version
[62:31] conflict let's downgrade
[62:33] numpy
[62:40] dude what is nump have to do with it
[62:44] what's nump got to do with this
[62:52] dude hey what's number I got to do with
[62:55] it dude
[63:02] 2 points0 10 stay focused on the task at
[63:05] hand your goals are waiting for your
[63:07] undivided attention thank you
[63:17] bro now it doesn't look like it's
[63:19] working actually but let's go ahead and
[63:21] try it over here
[63:25] I mean the easiest way is to use cap cut
[63:28] of course but I'm trying to make this
[63:29] automated for you dude so use cap cut
[63:32] for now and you could already have some
[63:34] videos
[63:35] done be honest all you got to do is pull
[63:38] these in bro and go to capop cut it's
[63:41] super
[63:43] sick so let's go show you that process
[63:47] here so cap cut all you got to do is
[63:50] pull one of these videos in bro and for
[63:53] example 03 mini for trading Pull It in
[63:56] let it load takes actually a minute
[63:58] because I got it from my external hard
[64:00] drive but um once it's in there then we
[64:03] can split it up I think that's the
[64:06] probably the problem here it's taking a
[64:07] little bit of seems to be stuck
[64:12] here these videos are like 10 gigabytes
[64:15] long so maybe this is a problem but it
[64:17] seems to be stuck right here and then it
[64:19] moves on after like 1% which is
[64:22] weird is there another library that we
[64:24] could try
[64:26] I don't want to try it yet I want to
[64:27] give it a give it a full couple minutes
[64:29] here
[65:07] is there another Library we could
[65:22] try that's the question bro bro
[65:27] is there another Library we could
[65:31] try Okay so while that is running dude
[65:34] you can see here like this is an hour
[65:37] long video and it's super easy to clip
[65:39] them up bro you just make this break
[65:41] this bigger so you can see it and then
[65:43] watch the part that you think it's going
[65:45] to be
[65:46] interesting I don't know what part's
[65:48] interesting dude but all you got to do
[65:49] is once you find that part that's
[65:51] interesting just like take like 5
[65:52] minutes to two hours of it and just
[65:55] upload it is a video dude so for example
[65:57] I just hit command B on Mac but command
[66:01] B on Mac or just select here click right
[66:04] click this and click split
[66:08] trim oops not trim
[66:11] sorry it's split split scene
[66:17] here no that ain't it either dude I
[66:20] don't know what it is it's command B
[66:22] though I'll tell you that much command B
[66:26] so command B on the max splits
[66:29] it
[66:31] B and then look at that that's a whole
[66:33] clip there you just delete the rest or
[66:36] you save it and you can say hey I'mma
[66:38] clip those yeah this is probably the
[66:39] better way to do it to be honest
[66:42] dude just grab the clips here and then
[66:45] you could copy it and you can say new
[66:47] new project here copy it and say okay
[66:51] and just put the clip in there dude
[66:53] paste it in
[66:57] and then click export I don't know if I
[66:59] saved it correctly
[67:00] but go back to uh C cut export new
[67:05] project C cut more layout back to
[67:15] homepage yeah dude so just clip these
[67:17] videos however you'd like and you can
[67:18] see my agent here 1% error processing no
[67:21] STD out looks like we ran into this air
[67:30] looks like we ran into this area here
[67:31] where only got 1% done these videos are
[67:34] like 10 gigabytes long so I don't know
[67:36] if that might be the problem
[68:04] ah yes I see the issue when dealing with
[68:05] such large sales we should modify the
[68:07] approach to use more memory efficient
[68:09] processing add progress tracking for
[68:11] each clip handle temporary
[68:14] okay say accept here well not quite
[68:28] okay there we
[68:29] go
[68:32] stop st for all
[68:36] here now let's try
[68:56] cap cut super easy
[68:58] dude just go here break the clips up
[69:02] break them up here and then all you do
[69:03] is you know if that was the clip you
[69:05] wanted to use we'll just delete these
[69:07] ones or bring it over like I tried to do
[69:09] actually I tried to bring it over to a
[69:11] new one file new new project here
[69:17] okay and then sometimes you could paste
[69:19] it in here I used to be able to but you
[69:22] could probably drag it to your desktop
[69:24] or whatever and just do that back to
[69:28] homepage here but essentially it's super
[69:31] easy to use cap cut just go here and
[69:35] let's say this is the clip that you make
[69:37] it's a 16-minute clip just delete the
[69:40] rest and then all you do is say export
[69:42] here and you export it to your computer
[69:45] and call it something good
[69:47] dude you can see this is clipping this
[69:50] nicely now finish videos finish Clips
[69:54] here Perfect Dude
[69:56] all right so this this is dope
[70:00] dude
[70:04] um you could name it whatever you want
[70:06] it to be like how to use 03 for trading
[70:12] and then just hit export and then once
[70:13] you export it just throw it up on your
[70:15] YouTube make a good thumbnail yeah had a
[70:17] great quote that said rest and not in
[70:19] the
[70:19] middle and that's something I always
[70:21] live by you know I'm not going to rest
[70:24] I'm going to keep on push there a lot of
[70:26] answers that I don't have even questions
[70:30] that I don't have but I'm just going to
[70:32] keep going I'm just going to keep going
[70:34] and I'll figure these things out as we
[70:35] go right let me know the charges it cost
[70:37] 25 RS so I try to live by that all the
[70:39] time rest at the rest at the end I don't
[70:42] build stuff for people under 25 racks
[70:45] dude
[70:46] so you you're better off learning it
[70:48] I'll show you how to do it so you can do
[70:50] it for yourself for the rest of your
[70:51] life I'll show you for $69 in the boot
[70:54] camp
[70:56] but otherwise it's 25 racks for any done
[70:58] for you type stuff so I'd rather just
[71:01] have you do it dude okay so you can see
[71:03] clip number one is
[71:05] done today I'm going to show you exactly
[71:09] how to use China's new deep seek AI
[71:12] which is 96% cheaper than any AI we've
[71:16] ever seen I'm going to use this deep
[71:18] seek AI to build the best trading
[71:21] strategies and not just some BS hey deep
[71:24] seat give me a trading strategy type
[71:26] stuff stay focused on your goals every
[71:29] minute spent on distractions is away
[71:32] from achieving your dreams look at that
[71:34] dude so okay look it makes 5 minute
[71:38] videos now I'm going to show you how to
[71:40] actually use
[71:42] 03 open make a title and a thumbnail for
[71:45] it and then upload that b and then you
[71:47] get paid
[71:49] bro so let's step on the
[71:53] gas West Coast family wake up earlier
[71:56] stay up late this is so far bro yes this
[72:01] one's not done yet
[72:04] but okay so Clips agent is lowkey done
[72:16] bro mid key
[72:21] actually um okay so this works great
[72:26] clip
[72:31] duration can you make the clip duration
[72:33] random between two different numbers so
[72:35] minimum clip duration and maximum clip
[72:37] duration so for example it will do a
[72:40] random amount between two numbers I
[72:42] don't know what the minimum clip
[72:44] duration currently is used for but if
[72:46] it's not used for anything let's make it
[72:47] so it outputs random uh sizes of videos
[72:51] based on seconds
[72:57] okay so steps to
[72:58] success how do I clip videos
[73:02] yes how to use how do
[73:05] I I clip videos with this
[73:10] code one put in my long
[73:16] videos here in into into this folder
[73:20] into this
[73:21] folder let's go uh pick that folder out
[73:27] raw
[73:28] Clips copy relative
[73:35] path what the
[73:51] [ __ ] put in my log videos into this
[73:54] folder path
[73:59] to uh run the code
[74:03] really uh make sure
[74:05] to to make
[74:08] sure to have this
[74:11] folder two and it will be uh copy
[74:14] relative
[74:17] path this is the
[74:22] output and then three
[74:27] run the code and wait
[74:30] for uh make a good
[74:34] thumbnail and title then
[74:38] upload to Youtube
[74:42] five wait for 10,000
[74:48] views okay that's it dude how do I clip
[74:51] videos manually
[74:56] how do I clip videos with
[74:58] this agent yo Tex I'm doing great bro
[75:02] how are you okay so how do I clip
[75:04] manually how do I clip with this agent
[75:06] okay you have two different ways to to
[75:10] make clips now and you also have
[75:13] unlimited videos to do this based off of
[75:17] so here we go Dropbox folder
[75:27] here are the training
[75:29] video to learn
[75:33] more to learn how to clip okay and then
[75:39] all of
[75:40] my all of my videos you can
[75:49] use you can
[75:51] also download from my YouTube channel
[75:53] Okay so moab's video splitter Here
[75:58] moab's video splitter agent for the ls
[76:01] bro for the
[76:03] ls for the ls bro for the ls okay let's
[76:07] go ahead and see how it does now let's
[76:10] delete these
[76:13] three Clips agent here so this is
[76:16] literally the one of the first agents
[76:19] dude that could just make you money bro
[76:23] cuz I know a lot of you guys are
[76:25] hungry and algo trading isn't going to
[76:28] make you money but if you have cash and
[76:30] you're trading it's going to make you a
[76:33] better Trader
[76:34] absolutely it's going to trade better
[76:37] humans can't trade dude humans can't
[76:40] trade well I've always believed that but
[76:42] some people don't believe that run the
[76:43] code and wait for for them to
[76:49] Output to the above folder so now I
[76:53] could run this code here and it should
[76:58] make the videos for me so let's run
[77:02] it okay it's using a random length
[77:05] creating 29 Random clips here so now I
[77:09] could just let this run over night or
[77:11] whatever and it will be done for me and
[77:14] then I could just upload them to
[77:17] YouTube That's fire dude I just showed
[77:19] you a way to print cash bro so much love
[77:23] to you glad you're here
[77:39] it's crazy
[77:43] huh cuz now you don't even have to make
[77:45] videos dude that's the craziest part
[77:47] about it because I understand like a lot
[77:48] of y'all don't want to make videos but
[77:50] like dude if you just take my videos and
[77:53] you can make better a better YouTube
[77:55] channel than I have is the thing like
[77:58] these two guys here that are crushing it
[78:01] they made better YouTube channels than I
[78:04] literally have and I put them in the the
[78:07] thing here so you have access to it but
[78:10] they just did a better they're doing a
[78:11] better job than me but it's me you know
[78:14] it's based off my
[78:16] videos which is [ __ ] fire bro because
[78:20] now like these guys got the boot camp
[78:22] for free and they're getting paid so you
[78:24] could go check them out as examples
[78:29] here creating clip
[78:32] one okay let me go ahead
[78:36] and make some updates here to the uh the
[78:40] server message because in
[78:43] the
[78:46] Discord I have
[78:49] um a message that's sent so let's go
[78:53] check that out and see if I can get that
[78:55] all set up you can see I just finished
[78:57] the first video here created this video
[79:00] how to how to use 03 for trading step
[79:04] one video one so that's absolutely fire
[79:08] I just showed you a way to make have an
[79:12] agent make cash for you bro that's crazy
[79:16] that's crazy dude that's
[79:18] crazy I love this game and I love
[79:20] sharing everything and I'm going to keep
[79:21] sharing everything I just have so much
[79:24] demand for like making some quick cash
[79:27] as a developer and it's just not the way
[79:30] to algo trade algo trading is if you
[79:33] have money and you're trading already
[79:35] and you have a strategy but you're not
[79:37] going to make zero to you're not going
[79:39] to go from zero to $10,000 off algo
[79:42] trading sorry bro maybe if you're in the
[79:46] trenches of solada but like yeah you're
[79:48] gambling so be careful out
[79:51] there but if you got a fast second of
[79:53] cash and you're Trad it right now you
[79:55] know for a fact a robot would trade it
[79:57] better so you can see here this outputed
[79:59] the first video
[80:02] here so how to
[80:04] use AI for trading clip
[80:08] one this is the first video and you can
[80:11] see it's 11 minutes I'm going to show
[80:13] you how to actually use 03 that's fire
[80:18] dude so it just clipped up the video for
[80:20] me
[80:22] 1080p beautiful beautiful beautiful and
[80:25] then what do I do from here I just go to
[80:26] reveal and finder here and I have it
[80:29] okay I have it and then I just go to my
[80:31] YouTube
[80:33] here and let's just try it out dude I
[80:36] could just say create upload
[80:39] video and then I just upload the video
[80:42] like how good you are on anything you
[80:44] don't have discipline you ain't nobody
[80:45] right you're nothing make Title Here
[80:48] give up under the slightest struggle
[80:50] without
[80:51] discipline discipline is doing what you
[80:53] hate to do but do it like you love it
[80:55] doing what you hate to do but do it like
[80:57] you love it that's that is a great quote
[81:01] and if you can do that you could be
[81:03] successful in anything well you normally
[81:05] are go to my YouTube and just copy my
[81:08] [Music]
[81:13] description maybe not the whole
[81:15] description but you know part of
[81:20] it copy it here and
[81:23] then post it in here
[81:26] dude obviously take the chapters out
[81:29] because that wouldn't be the right
[81:31] chapters and you can see how to use oa3
[81:34] for trading and then all you have to do
[81:35] dude is add the thumbnail now if you
[81:38] want to use my exact thumbnail you can
[81:40] always just say download thumbnail copy
[81:44] link address and say uh YouTube
[81:49] thumbnail
[81:51] downloader and then you could use my
[81:53] same thumbnail if you want you have full
[81:55] permission to everything
[81:57] bro get thumbnail images here you can
[82:00] see you could just download it here save
[82:02] image
[82:03] as
[82:06] okay
[82:08] Dy and then back to YouTube dude super
[82:12] duper
[82:14] easy upload
[82:17] thumbnail I can just get that from here
[82:20] [Music]
[82:21] dude upload thumbnail
[82:25] gain access I got to verify whatever but
[82:28] the process of upload a YouTube video is
[82:30] super simple so you could see it there
[82:32] you go you got it all dude you got it
[82:34] all now and you know how exactly how to
[82:37] use this I'm clipping these videos on
[82:40] your goals and the distractions will
[82:42] fade we literally let's get back to
[82:44] coding or trading we just built this
[82:46] together dude and this Clipper is a l
[82:50] like 930 that was a good move by making
[82:52] it random here because now all your
[82:55] videos are going to be different sizes
[82:57] medium high or
[82:59] low that show you step chat when I when
[83:02] I when this timer says to dude this is
[83:05] so fire bro okay so what I'm going to do
[83:08] is I'm going to kill this now and I'm
[83:09] going to say uh I'm going to delete
[83:11] these videos so it doesn't uh clog up
[83:14] your GitHub or
[83:17] whatever and I believe this AI agent
[83:21] here for clipping videos is version one
[83:24] is zero there's not much AI to it to be
[83:26] honest but what you don't need to
[83:29] overuse AI you know uh Mund AI agents
[83:33] okay raw Clips raw Clips raw vids you're
[83:37] going to use raw Clips finish
[83:40] fds videos okay that's it dude I just
[83:45] wanted to show you that so you know how
[83:46] to do it now if you have any questions
[83:48] let me know let me go ahead and update
[83:50] the
[83:52] uh where did I put that
[83:58] clipbot
[84:08] y
[84:11] um let's go ahead and send all of this
[84:19] here okay
[84:27] I have all of the above that I want to
[84:29] add to my message that I send and also
[84:32] say updated February 5th
[84:37] 2025 and then keep everything that I
[84:40] said in the original message besides the
[84:43] parts that like contradict each other
[84:46] like it's now 69 thou $69 per the 10
[84:49] first 10,000 videos and then uh or views
[84:53] and then it goes higher so obviously up
[84:56] that update that part cuz that changed
[84:59] keep all the links to the YouTube
[85:00] trainings and add in the new information
[85:03] that I have above as well and um yeah we
[85:07] just need to make the message better
[85:09] because there's more stuff added to it
[85:11] so essentially look at the message that
[85:13] we currently have and then the message I
[85:15] sent you above in order to make a better
[85:18] message that has all the new stuff and
[85:21] the new updates
[85:24] okay let's duplicate this just in case I
[85:26] [ __ ] it up D
[85:28] copy and view
[85:34] okay please don't delete the videos I
[85:37] already deleted them why would I not
[85:38] delete them they're right here all the
[85:40] videos are right here shorty Susan
[85:42] they're right here all the videos are in
[85:45] the
[85:46] Dropbox and uh you have access to it so
[85:48] I'm going get add. get
[85:52] commitm uh
[85:54] clip agent to make
[85:57] money get push
[86:00] okay so we're going to go to get push
[86:02] here and you can see all of the the code
[86:06] is now updated here hopefully yes you
[86:09] can see clip agent it here okay so this
[86:12] Clips it up for you dude and input
[86:16] directory you could say here I I'll I'll
[86:18] make this a little more clear grab some
[86:21] videos and put it in your import
[86:22] directory here
[86:28] get some videos from
[86:32] here here and put in
[86:36] input
[86:40] directory
[86:43] folder
[86:48] okay and I should put that above because
[86:50] I'm a Noob tubing [ __ ]
[86:55] okay get
[86:56] add get
[86:58] commit and then uh
[87:03] clip get push
[87:12] okay I hope you
[87:14] created um
[87:28] you can see the original messages here
[87:30] and then combine it with my above
[87:32] message to make a more better
[87:35] message a more better yes that boy is
[87:38] slick screen
[87:56] oh nice successful examples
[88:09] perfect so we got AI that can make Clips
[88:13] dude and you could go check out other
[88:14] streamers too dude this is just a way to
[88:17] make money because everybody comes to me
[88:19] thinking this is like Alo trading is a
[88:21] way to make a bunch of money but if you
[88:23] have Z that it's absolutely not a way to
[88:26] make money you know you got to have
[88:28] money to trade and trading is extremely
[88:32] dangerous so I just want to start
[88:34] showing you guys some I've showed you
[88:36] everything I pretty much know about algo
[88:38] trading and obviously I'm going to keep
[88:40] working and keep building but dude I
[88:43] just get so many people being like yo
[88:45] how do I make money as a developer how
[88:47] do I make money coding and here's here's
[88:50] a quick easy way while you're leered bro
[88:53] so
[88:54] it's not like I don't want to it's not
[88:56] like a get rich quick by any means but
[88:58] hey you get paid a little bit while
[88:59] you're learning the code that's
[89:02] cool okay let's go see what this message
[89:05] looks like
[89:11] now let's go here and say clip channel
[89:15] so Clips here
[89:18] Clips oh we got an air
[89:25] I think we need to split this into a
[89:27] couple
[89:45] messages come on come on come
[89:51] on yes baby good morning
[89:55] good morning princess how you doing you
[89:59] look cute as ever cute as ever okay so
[90:03] let's say accept here
[90:15] okay okay there we
[90:20] go Okay so
[90:24] we could drop
[90:25] uh since this is a Discord message we
[90:28] can remove the join our Discord
[90:31] part because there are this is actually
[90:34] being sent to
[90:38] Discord what else okay so updated
[90:41] February 5th 2025 I believe code is a
[90:43] great C that's why I share every single
[90:45] line of code I create every day I do
[90:48] this through streaming my coding of
[90:49] trading alos every single day now I
[90:51] understand that that's hard to watch all
[90:54] the streams and videos and I get a lot
[90:55] of people asking me to make shorter more
[90:57] digestible videos unfortunately I am
[91:00] fully focused on algo trading and
[91:02] achieving all of my wildest
[91:04] goals in Quant
[91:10] so I can't spend my time searching
[91:12] through the good parts editing and
[91:13] clipping them so I've created two ways
[91:15] for you to help
[91:17] Spread spread uh spread coding knowledge
[91:21] while earning manual clipping download
[91:22] cap cut find interesting parts of my
[91:24] videos and make 5 to 10
[91:28] 2our 5 minute to 2our Clips create
[91:31] engaging thumbnails and titles post on
[91:33] YouTube no shorts AI agent clipping put
[91:37] long video uh and then in the AI agent
[91:40] uh let's go ahead here
[92:01] okay so earning structure here AI agent
[92:04] clipping earning structure 2.010 stay
[92:07] focused on the task at hand your coding
[92:09] and trading goals are within reach if
[92:11] you keep your mind sharp and your
[92:12] efforts
[92:20] consistent okay let's go ahead and put
[92:22] another line break right
[92:34] there okay earning structure 10,000
[92:37] views per month 69 per 10,000 views
[92:40] 30,000 views per
[92:46] month 100,000 views per
[92:50] month I think that's a little aggressive
[92:53] dude I'm going to scale that back a
[92:55] little
[92:56] bit um let's think about that real quick
[93:45] whatever where to get
[93:47] videos my YouTube channel
[93:55] um where to get videos from my YouTube
[94:05] channel okay success examples check out
[94:08] these channels crushing it

[94:24] get started watch training video here
[94:26] join our Discord questions post
[94:51] below and then let's make a Clips chat
[94:59] this is a

[102:02] having fun bro so you're the best man
[102:05] thank you bro you're so sweet appreciate
[102:08] you bro let's put a whale here on this
[102:11] one AI agent
[102:14] okay do we need the API you have you
[102:16] need no API you need nothing you don't
[102:19] even need to know how to code you don't
[102:20] even know how to code need to know how
[102:22] to code to start clipping bro you don't
[102:24] even need to know how to code I just
[102:26] made it easier if you do know how to
[102:33] code but it's not
[102:37] required it's not required bro
[102:40] bro that's pretty fire dude 2.010 stay
[102:44] focused on your goals and remember that
[102:46] every moment spent on distractions is a
[102:49] moment away from achieving greatness
[102:55] so once you hit 10,000
[103:01] views simply email us
[103:05] uh simply email your Discord when you
[103:11] hit
[103:13] 10K and we will add you
[103:19] okay no API nothing needed for the clips
[103:23] Channel bro okay let's see if this looks
[103:26] good
[103:27] now and please let me know if you have
[103:29] any questions because I can't go over
[103:31] this every day obviously I got to get
[103:33] back to the Grind dude I got to get back
[103:36] to building so these clips you know you
[103:39] have content to clip bro so this is uh
[103:42] this is infinite this is infinite for
[103:44] you if you're outside the US if you're
[103:46] in the US it's only up to 500 a month
[103:48] but or a year a year but I believe Cod
[103:51] is a great equalizer that's why share
[103:53] every single line of code I create every
[103:55] day I do this through streaming my code
[103:58] of trading alos every single
[104:00] day now I understand that's that's hard
[104:05] to watch that it
[104:09] is I understand
[104:13] that it is hard to watch hard to watch
[104:17] all the streams and videos and I get a
[104:19] lot of people asking me to make shorter
[104:21] more digestible videos unfortunately I
[104:23] am fully focused on algo
[104:26] trading and achieving all my wildest
[104:28] goals in Quant so I can't spend my time
[104:31] searching for the good parts of my
[104:32] videos editing them and clipping them so
[104:35] I've created two ways for you to help
[104:37] spread coding knowledge while
[104:39] earning manual clippy download cap cut
[104:42] find interesting parts of my videos and
[104:44] make 5 minute to 2our Clips create
[104:47] engaging thumbnails and titles posts on
[104:49] YouTube no
[104:50] shorts AI agent clipping box
[104:53] put log videos in the
[104:56] source data raw clips and it ends in the
[104:59] Finish Clips run the AI agent and wait
[105:01] for the process Clips add thumbnail
[105:04] title and upload to Youtube the earning
[105:06] structure here is 10,000 views per month
[105:09] you get $69 per 10,000 views if you get
[105:12] 30,000 it's 89 per 10,000 views if you
[105:15] get 50,000 it's 100 per 10,000 views if
[105:18] you get 100,000 views per month you get
[105:21] 149 per 10,000 views that's that's
[105:24] aggressive dude I'm going to change that
[105:26] to 129 because that's a little
[105:28] aggressive for
[105:34] now okay so bonus hit 10,000 views a
[105:38] month to access the clips Channel with
[105:40] view growing training so this is the
[105:43] clips Channel I will go ahead and add
[105:45] training to this I will add I will give
[105:47] you everything dude I will teach you
[105:49] everything that I know
[106:01] so it's 129 that's double dude wait is
[106:03] that double no it's not it's 139 it's
[106:06] double let's make it 139
[106:12] then clip spot I made it
[106:14] 139 okay my YouTube channel Google to
[106:17] download them okay so you could go to my
[106:19] YouTube channel and download any of
[106:22] these videos
[106:24] [ __ ] I might have just got flagged for
[106:26] that but
[106:31] um examples success examples check out
[106:34] these channels crushing it and you can
[106:37] see there my YouTube channel okay
[106:39] Dropbox here this will get you all of
[106:40] the videos that we have so far uploaded
[106:43] but you can also use any of the YouTube
[106:45] videos you have full permission and this
[106:48] is my permission this is me giving you
[106:49] permission dude so full permission if
[106:52] you're doing it for Clips if you're
[106:53] doing it for some other stuff then
[106:55] obviously ask me
[106:56] but I'm a chill guy I'm a chill guy so
[106:59] anyways that's all the videos there I
[107:01] don't know why it's taking so long to
[107:02] open up maybe because it's a fat folder
[107:04] now but whatever um here's some examples
[107:08] important notes YouTube only USA
[107:11] residents are limited 500 per year
[107:13] unlimited for the rest of the world
[107:15] payments via crypto 1 and 15th of each
[107:18] month uh email Mev onyt with your links
[107:22] and stats you hit 10K views here's the
[107:24] videos that we have so far you could use
[107:27] and you have you could see 8 gbt 6 GB 13
[107:30] gbes a lot of [ __ ] videos dude a lot
[107:33] of good content here dude so I think
[107:37] this is everything does anybody have any
[107:40] questions because I think that this is
[107:42] I've explained everything and you have
[107:45] everything now do you guys have any
[107:48] questions your ideas and execution are
[107:51] lit bro I hope hope to get to your level
[107:54] of coding thank you bro much love to
[108:06] you okay so anybody have any questions
[108:10] about this any questions about the clip
[108:13] agent let's go ahead and make sure it's
[108:16] up there let's go to my uh GitHub here
[108:20] cursor I think it is and let's go ahead
[108:23] here go to the read me and say
[108:28] 25 x here and say 25
[108:32] here and let's say clip
[108:35] agent clip agent to make money
[108:41] completed and let's just go to it
[108:45] dude it's uh clip agent Clips agent
[108:48] Clips
[108:50] agent make money by
[108:54] clipping my videos my
[108:59] streams into short
[109:03] digestible
[109:07] videos um
[109:11] okay clips agent.
[109:15] py and you can see full training here
[109:21] and then we'll go ahead and put that
[109:22] that here in the um put the Discord link
[109:28] there so the Discord link should be
[109:31] Clips agent and then let's go here to
[109:34] that
[109:37] Discord okay let's go to Clips agent
[109:41] here go to read me here and let's go
[109:44] ahead and paste it in there okay and
[109:46] then say get ad do get oh and also
[109:51] actually
[109:53] Clips agent
[109:55] Clips
[109:59] agent 2.010 stay focused on the task at
[110:02] hand every line of code closer to go
[110:05] that helps clip long videos into shorter
[110:12] ones so you can upload to to your
[110:16] YouTube to your
[110:18] YouTube and get paid
[110:22] more
[110:25] info more info is in the code notes end
[110:33] here okay let's say get add dot
[110:41] get add. get
[110:46] commitm clip agent to make
[110:51] money get push now I have something for
[110:54] you guys to like make money because
[110:56] everybody comes to me Mev please I need
[110:59] to make some money and it's like dude
[111:02] you're in the wrong place because if you
[111:03] have zero dollars you literally can't
[111:05] trade and if you're trading with a tiny
[111:07] bit of money you're going to end up
[111:09] using too much leverage and you're going
[111:10] to get wrecked bro so you got to get
[111:13] your cash up if you want to trade bro so
[111:16] this is probably it's what's called
[111:18] machine learning easiest way on the
[111:19] internet so you find
[111:23] things that are predictive you might
[111:26] guess oh such and such should be
[111:30] predictive might be predictive and you
[111:32] test it out on the computer and maybe it
[111:33] isn't maybe it isn't you test it out on
[111:36] longterm historical
[111:38] data and uh price data and other things
[111:41] and then you add to the system this if
[111:44] it if it works and if it doesn't you you
[111:47] throw it out so there aren't elaborate
[111:49] equations at least not for
[111:58] um let's go to the thing again and say
[112:03] uh okay so that's good let's go ahead
[112:06] and back out of that and then let's go
[112:08] to this post that post
[112:20] here should be like AI security or our
[112:24] post or Discord Discord security here
[112:28] and then let's go ahead and say Clips
[112:31] agent here copy Channel
[112:41] ID and let's add this
[112:51] F
[113:21] for e
[113:56] go
[113:58] here x that out
[114:31] I will never ask you to send me
[114:42] money so
[114:44] please be
[114:47] careful of scammers okay so let's go to
[114:52] screen R
[114:56] security uh screen
[114:59] LS security security security Discord
[115:06] security screen R here and then let's go
[115:10] ahead and run this back so this new
[115:12] security thing will have the Clips in it
[115:15] just so you can see it
[115:34] okay so that's that's solid
[115:55] okay this security message is better
[116:01] now make money but to grow your Capital
[116:04] if you find an edge if you need to make
[116:06] money now and want to learn to code go
[116:08] here I will never ask you to send money
[116:11] so okay perfect so now the clips thing
[116:14] that spam you guys every day will now
